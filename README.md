## Tips

* Reuse as much code as possible.
* Think about which elements to animate, you have different choices.
* Think about how to swap the right hand.
* Consider proper use of `transform-origin`

## For fun

Use other emojis to play around.
On a Ubuntu Maschine you could use a program called `Characters` to pick the symbols.

## Note
For teaching reasons this exercise uses nested `<figure>` elements for easy positioning. 

Prevent that in production projects (Rule of thumb: use one `<figure>` element per graphical content, you can describe separately in a `<figcaption>`).
